# Live Color Picker

A color picker that uses your camera. Just hold your camera up to an object, touch a part of the screen, and the color will be displayed. You can even save the color by tapping on the large circle icon. You can also let the application pick out and save the most vibrant colors in the scene algorithmically. Colors and palettes can be saved for viewing later on.
